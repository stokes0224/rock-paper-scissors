This is my first version of Rock, Paper, Scissors in JavaScript for the Odin Project. This currently works in the browser console.

The initial concepts made sense, but I had built functions in isolation so joining up the dots to make the final game was difficult.

Much appreciation to people who had asked similar questions on Stack Overflow and the content on w3schools, which really got me through this.
